Programming Assignment 1
------------------------

This program is run by first running the 'make' command in the project directory to compile.
After compilation, type './my-count x y input.txt output.txt' where:

x: num_elements
y: num_cores
input.txt: input file name (e.g. A.txt)
output.txt: output file name (e.g. B.txt)

After running, you will find the results in the file you designated as the output file.
I had no partner in making this project.
